Using this form the user can select sections to be included in the print-out, the sections correspond to the tab pages of the Exception Reporter.<BR/> After selection the print sections to include the user is then prompted to select a printer. After a printer has been selected the Exception Reporter printing process begins.
<H2>Copy</H2>
Pressing the <i>Copy</i> button causes all information displayed on the Exception Reporter to be copied to clipboard.  The user can then paste this information into Word or other application. The user can potentially paste this information into an e-mail, although the <i>E-Mail</i> control button described later is intended for this purpose. 
<H2>Save</H2>
Pressing the <i>Save</i> button causes all information included in the Exception Reporter to be saved to a text file.  The user will be prompted to select the location and name of the text file to save.
<H2>E-Mail</H2>
The Exception Reporter supports to methods of e-mail, these are <i>SMTP</i> and <i>Simple MAPI</i> (default).  The method used is determined by properties set for the specific instance of the Exception Reporter.<BR/><BR/> If <i>SMTP</i> is used, pressing the E-Mail button causes an e-mail to be sent directly to an e-mail address specified as a property of the Exception Reporter. The user is notified that the e-mail has been sent. <b>Note:</b> For SMTP to be used, the Exception Reporter must be set with a valid SMTP Server, to and from e-mail addresses, and, where neccessary, SMTP authentication username and password.
<BR/><BR/>
Where <i>Simple MAPI</i> is used, pressing the <i>E-Mail</i> button causes the user's e-mail client to show a Send Mail form.  The form is pre-loaded with details of the exception and a specified recipient address.  The user is able to modify the message and addresses prior to sending the e-mail. <b>Note:</b> For <i>Simple MAPI</i> to be used, the user must have a suitable mail client installed (Outlook etc).
