The Exceptions tab page displays details of the .Net Exception that was thrown by the application.  Exceptions often originate within a class or module deep within the application, and the exception may be caught and rethrown several times before reaching the user interface layer and being displayed by the Exception Reporter.  For this reason, this tab lists all inner exceptions so that the pathway from the origin of error and the top level exception passed to the Exception Reporter can be seen.<BR/><BR/>
This technical information provides the system or application message describing the problem.
