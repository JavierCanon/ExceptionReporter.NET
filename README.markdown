# Exception Reporter

ExceptionReporter is a .NET component that shows a dialog with detailed information on an Exception and the application/system running it. It allows the application user to copy, save and/or email a textual report of the incident.


### Future Movements

There is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) project in the solution with the bare minimum of code. It's just a skeletal beginning.
This is not part of this release yet.
