** Changes so far for 2nd drop (1st drop on CodePlex - post SourceForge project) **

[Functionality]

- The enumerating of printers is completely removed (can cause random hanging, is expensive, and probably of little use to 99% of users (?))

- Printing functionality is in limbo (not sure the best way to include it, I suspect it is best to include it somehow)

[CONFIG CHANGES]
- I've changed config to use it's own config section - see docs (or Demo App) for what to do. Basically, copy the sample config and edit it as necessary.

[OTHER CHANGES]
- Most of the changes are code/design - and it was basically a complete redesign (I wouldn't say rewrite - but practically every line of code has changed - maybe that is a rewrite....)

- Updated and improved the documentation.
