Exception Reporter
------------------
ExceptionReporter is a .NET component that shows a dialog with detailed information on an Exception and the application/system running it. It allows the application user to copy, save and/or email a textual report of the incident.

See documention in doc/index.html

[FUTURE MOVEMENTS]
There is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) project in the solution with the bare minimum of code. It's just a skeletal beginning.
This is not part of this release, but hopefully will be ready for the next release, when we've had some time to work on it.
