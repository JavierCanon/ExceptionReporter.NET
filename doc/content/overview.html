<i>Exception Reporter</i> is a .NET WinForms component that provides a solution to receiving technical information about exceptions in an application.
</p>
<p>
Exception Reporter shows a dialog that contains technical details of an exception (including inner exceptions) and gathers details about the system that might help the developer to pin-point the issue. Exception Reporter provides the facility to email/save/copy an <a href="ControlButtons.html">Exception Report</a>. Much of the interface is <a href="Configuration.html">configurable</a> - allowing for custom label messages and showing/hiding tabs based on your application requirements.
