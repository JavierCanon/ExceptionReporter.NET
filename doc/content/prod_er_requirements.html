<H1>6. Requirements</H1>
The Exception Reporter has been designed for the .Net Framework version 1.1. <BR/></BR>If you are interested in using the Exception Reporter in a .Net Framework version 1.0 environment register your interest by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:contact@stratalogic.com">contact@stratalogic.com</a>. If there is sufficient interest we will provide a version for this environment on the downloads page.<BR/><BR/>
The E-Mail capability of the Exception Reporter uses either SMTP or the Simple MAPI protocol.  If using SMTP the Exception Reporter must be configured with appropriate SMTP details.  If using Simple MAPI the user's machine must be configured with a suitable mail client (such as Outlook). The Simple MAPI process of the Exception Reporter makes use of <i>MAPI32.dll</i> which is installed as part of suitable mail clients.
<BR/></BR>
The only reference that need be added to your project is a reference to the installed <i>SLSExceptionReporter.dll</i>.  This file should be deployed with your application.
